        <h2>Why Bali?</h2>
        <h3>Bali</h3>
        <p>
          Indonesia is a country of thousands of islands and while Bali is
          considered an island, it's also a province with a few smaller islands
          in its territory.. Bali's waters are
          teeming with marine life with at least 2,000 species of fish and other
          creatures including coral reefs, dolphins, turtles and much more. This
          is due to the fact that Bali sits in the centre of the Coral Triangle,
          the world's centre of marine biodiversity, also dubbed "the Amazon of
          the seas".
        </p>
        <p>
          Bali has two active volcanoes; Mount Batur standing at over 1,700
          metres tall and Mount Agung which is 3,000 metres tall. Hiking up
          these mountains will give you a stunning view of the island that no
          Bali souvenir can replace. Besides white beaches, Bali has multiple
          beaches with black sand as well. Thanks to the island's two active
          volcanoes, you can have a one-of-a-kind experience at black sand
          volcanic beaches such as Lovina and Amed Beach during your Bali trip.

              Hi! My name is Cheryl and it is my dream to visit Bali in the near
              future. I'm very fond of the city. I created this page as part of
              a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
