            <h2>Why Bali?</h2>
            <h3>Bali</h3>
            <p>
              Indonesia is a country of thousands of islands and while Bali is
              considered an island, it's also a province with a few smaller
              islands in its territory.. Bali's waters are teeming with marine
              life with at least 2,000 species of fish and other creatures
              including coral reefs, dolphins, turtles and much more. This is
              due to the fact that Bali sits in the centre of the Coral
              Triangle, the world's centre of marine biodiversity, also dubbed
              "the Amazon of the seas".
            </p>
            <p>
              Bali has two active volcanoes; Mount Batur standing at over 1,700
              metres tall and Mount Agung which is 3,000 metres tall. Hiking up
              these mountains will give you a stunning view of the island that
              no Bali souvenir can replace. Besides white beaches, Bali has
              multiple beaches with black sand as well. Thanks to the island's
              two active volcanoes, you can have a one-of-a-kind experience at
              black sand volcanic beaches such as Lovina and Amed Beach during
              your trip.
